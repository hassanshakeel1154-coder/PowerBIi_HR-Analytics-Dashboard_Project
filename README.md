# PowerBIi_HR-Analytics-Dashboard_Project
My first Power BI project: an HR Analytics Dashboard that shows insights on employee attrition, job roles, salaries, and demographics. Helps HR teams understand workforce trends and improve employee retention strategies
📊 HR Analytics Dashboard – Power BI

📌 Project Overview

This is my very first project in Power BI! 🚀 I created an HR Analytics Dashboard to explore employee attrition and understand workforce trends. The goal was to turn raw HR data into clear, interactive visuals that can actually help HR teams make better decisions.

🔍 What’s Inside?

A quick snapshot of total employees, attrition, attrition rate, average age, salary, and years in the company.

Breakdown of attrition by age, gender, education background, salary ranges, and job roles.

Insights into job satisfaction levels and how they relate to employee turnover.

A timeline view showing attrition by year to spot trends over time.

✨ Key Findings

Employees aged 26–35 have the highest attrition.

Most people leaving come from Life Sciences and Medical education backgrounds.

Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives are the top roles with high attrition.

Majority of employees leaving earn up to 5k salary.

Lower job satisfaction (level 1–2) is strongly linked to higher attrition.

🛠️ Tools I Used

Power BI – for building the dashboard

Excel/CSV – as the source dataset

💡 Why This Project Matters

This dashboard gives a simple but powerful view of HR data. It helps spot problem areas like high turnover in specific job roles or salary ranges, so companies can work on better employee retention strategies.
